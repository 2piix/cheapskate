- Alternative renderer for [Tag Text] (to use with xss-sanitize)
- Ability to manipulate code blocks


Note:
- tried replacing Text with ByteString, but performance impact was
  minimal.
- tried a tagsoup renderer - benchmark went from 0.24 to 0.3 - but
  this will avoid a costly step of rendering Html to Text,
  then going through xss-sanitize, which uses parseTags anyway...
- with the tagsoup (tagsoup branch) we need to change the way
  we parse raw html blocks, ideally using the tagsoup parser
  itself.... but this might conflict with the line-by-line
  strategy.  case in point:

  <!--

  ok

  -->

  This isn't a complete tag, so there's no way we can include it in
  the tagsoup token tree without completing it, and tagsoup currently
  renders the top line <!---->.

  if we parse til the closing tag, then I suppose the problem goes away.
